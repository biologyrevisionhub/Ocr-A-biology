# OCR A Level Biology Revision and Study Skills

Welcome to the A Level Biology Revision and Study Skills website — a curated collection of notes, model answers, and learning resources created to support students studying the OCR A Biology specification. This site is designed to help learners strengthen both their scientific understanding and their ability to recall and apply knowledge effectively in examinations.

Each topic page corresponds directly to the OCR A specification and includes concise explanations, visual resources, and opportunities for self-testing. The materials are developed with clarity and accuracy in mind, ensuring alignment with the current specification content.

In addition to topic-based revision, this site provides a dedicated **Study Skills** section built on research from cognitive science and educational psychology. The strategies presented — such as active recall, spaced repetition, interleaving, and brain dumps — are all evidence-based approaches proven to improve long-term memory and exam performance. Students are guided through how to apply these techniques effectively to biology content, developing independence and resilience as learners.

### Key Features
- Clear, specification-aligned revision resources for all OCR A Biology modules  
- Focus on exam application and analysis skills  
- Study Skills hub with research-backed revision strategies  
- Downloadable notes and model answers  
- Accessible for students and teachers alike  

This project aims to make high-quality, evidence-informed revision support freely available to all A Level Biology students. Whether used for class revision, independent study, or teaching reference, the site encourages active engagement with the subject and supports the development of effective, self-regulated learners.
